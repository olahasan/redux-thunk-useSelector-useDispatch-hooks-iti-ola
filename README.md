## what-i-learned
Through this project:
1. I learned in this project how to create react app and treat with function component,
2. how to deal with redux [Redux thunk - Hooks - useSelector - useDispatch -combineReducers -action creators - REDUX_DEVTOOLS_EXTENSION]
4. how to deal with REDUX_DEVTOOLS_EXTENSION
5. how to deal with useSelector-useDispatch
6. how to deploy it on netlify and serge

## Continued Development
In the future, I plan to:
- learn more about reactJs Hooks.
- learn redux toolkit with reactJs Hooks.
